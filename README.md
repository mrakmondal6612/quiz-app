# Quiz Application

## Project Overview

This is a **Web-based Quiz Application** built using **React.js**, with a focus on **gamification**, interactivity, and a smooth user experience. The quiz fetches data from a remote API and presents it to the user in a dynamic and engaging interface. The application supports multiple-choice questions (MCQs), tracks the user's score, and displays results at the end.

**Key Features**:

- Fetches quiz data dynamically from an external API.
- Displays multiple-choice questions.
- Tracks user score and displays quiz completion results.
- Gamified elements (e.g., scoring and question progression).
- Clean and responsive UI.
- Simple navigation and quiz start/restart functionality.
